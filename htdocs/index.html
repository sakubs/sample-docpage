          <p>The term responsive design was coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, 
            and described the use of three techniques in combination.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was 
              already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in 
              Marcotte's article, 
              <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/" 
                target="_blank">Fluid Grids
              </a> (published in 2009 on A List Apart).</li>
            <li>The second technique was the idea of <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images" target="_blank">fluid 
              images</a>. Using a very simple technique of setting the <code>max-width</code> property to <code>100%</code>, images would 
              scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger. This 
              enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become 
              pixellated if the column becomes wider than the image.</li>
            <li>The third key component was the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries" target="_blank">media query</a>. Media Queries 
              enable the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than 
              having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, 
              or alternate navigation could be displayed.</li>
          </ol>
        
          <p>It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design isn't a separate technology</strong> â€” it is a term used to 
            describe an approach to web design, or a set of best practices, used to create a layout that can <em>respond</em> to the device 
            being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration this meant flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, 
            however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS layout 
            methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built into the web platform to make designing responsive sites 
            easier.</p>
        
          <p>The rest of this article will point you to the various web platform features you might want to use when creating a 
            responsive site.</p>

        <header id="Media_Queries">Media Queries</header>
          <p>Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query. The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a Candidate 
            Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was deemed ready for implementation in browsers. Media Queries allow us to run a series 
            of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to 
            style the page appropriately for the user's needs.</p>

        <p>For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide. The CSS for the <code>.container</code> selector will only be applied if these two things are true.</p>
        
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>@media screen and (min-width: 800px) { 
          .container { 
            margin: 1em 2em; 
          } 
        } </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the layout changed, are known as <em>breakpoints</em>.</p>
        
        <p>A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones), then check for larger screens and implement a multiple column layout when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. This is often described as <strong>mobile first</strong> design.</p>
