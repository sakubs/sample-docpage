        <p>
          The term responsive design was coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, 
          and described the use of three techniques in combination.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was 
            already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in 
            Marcotte's article, 
            <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/" 
              target="_blank">
              Fluid Grids
            </a> (published in 2009 on A List Apart).
          </li>
          <li>
            The second technique was the idea of 
            <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images" 
              target="_blank">
              fluid images
            </a>. Using a very simple technique of setting the 
            <code>
              max-width
            </code> property to 
            <code>
              100%
            </code>, images would scale down smaller if their containing 
            column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but 
            never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit 
            in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not 
            grow larger and become pixellated if the column becomes wider 
            than the image.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third key component was the 
            <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries" target="_blank">
              media query
            </a>. 
            Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron 
            Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. 
            Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout 
            could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller 
            screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design 
          isn't a separate technology</strong> â€” it is a term used to 
          describe an approach to web design, or a set of best practices, 
          used to create a layout that can <em>respond</em> to the device 
          being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration 
          this meant flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, 
          however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, 
          working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS layout 
          methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built 
          into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of this article will point you to the various web 
          platform features you might want to use when creating a 
          responsive site.
        </p>

      <section id="Media_Queries" class="main-section">
        <header>Media Queries</header>
        <p>
          Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query. 
          The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a Candidate 
          Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was deemed ready for 
          implementation in browsers. Media Queries allow us to run a series 
          of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain 
          width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to 
          style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following media query tests to see if the current 
          web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a 
          printed document) and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide. 
          The CSS for the <code>.container</code> selector will only be 
          applied if these two things are true.
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre class="brush: css"><code>
            @media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
              .container {
                margin: 1em 2em;
              }
            }
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking 
          your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen 
          sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the 
          layout changed, are known as <em>breakpoints</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple 
          single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones), 
          then check for larger screens and implement a multiple column layout 
          when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. This 
          is often described as <strong>mobile first</strong> design.

        <p>
          Responsive sites don't just change their layout between breakpoints, 
          they are built on flexible grids. A flexible grid means that you 
          don't need to target every possible device size that there is, and 
          build a pixel perfect layout for it. That approach would be 
          impossible given the vast number of differently-sized devices that 
          exist, and the fact that on desktop at least, people do not always 
          have their browser window maximized.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and 
          change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad. 
          For example if the line lengths become unreadably long as the screen 
          size increases, or a box becomes squashed with two words on each line 
          as it narrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early days of responsive design our only option for performing 
          layout was to use <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats">
          floats</a>. Flexible floated layouts were achieved by giving each 
          element a percentage width, and ensuring that across the layout the 
          totals were not more than 100%. In his original piece on fluid grids, 
          Marcotte detailed a formula for taking a layout designed using pixels 
          and converting it into percentages.
        </p>
        <pre><code>target / context = result</code></pre>
        
        <p>
          For example if our target column size is 60 pixels, and the context 
          (or container) it is in is 960 pixels, we divide 60 by 960 to get a 
          value we can use in our CSS, after moving the decimal point two 
          places to the right.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>.col { 
          width: 6.25%; /* 60 / 960 = 0.0625 */ 
        }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This approach will be found in many places across the web today, and 
          it is documented here in the layout section of our 
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Legacy_Layout_Methods">
          Legacy layout methods</a> article. It is likely that you will come 
          across websites using this approach in your work, so it is worth 
          understanding it, even though you would not build a modern site 
          using a float-based flexible grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example demonstrates a simple responsive design using 
          Media Queries and a flexible grid. On narrow screens the layout 
          displays the boxes stacked on top of one another:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img 
            alt="A mobile view of the layout with boxes stacked on 
            top of each other vertically." 
            src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16836/mdn-rwd-mobile.png" 
            style="display: block; height: 407px; width: 300px;">
            <p>
              On wider screens they move to two columns:
            </p>
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img 
            alt="A desktop view of a layout with two columns." 
            src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16837/mdn-rwd-desktop.png" 
            style="display: block; height: 217px; width: 600px;">
          <figcaption></figcaption>

        <header>Responsive Images</header>
        <p>
          The simplest approach to responsive images was as described in 
          Marcotte's early articles on responsive design. Basically, you 
          would take an image that was at the largest size that might be 
          needed, and scale it down. This is still an approach used today, 
          and in most stylesheets you will find the following CSS somewhere:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>
          img {
            max-width: 100%:
          } 
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          There are obvious downsides to this approach. The image might be 
          displayed a lot smaller than its intrinsic size, which is a waste of 
          bandwidth â€” a mobile user may be downloading an image several times 
          the size of what they actually see in the browser window. In 
          addition, you may not want the same image aspect ratio on mobile as 
          on desktop. For example, it might be nice to have a square image for 
          mobile, but show the same scene as a landscape image on desktop. Or, 
          acknowledging the smaller size of an image on mobile you might want 
          to show a different image altogether, one which is more easily 
          understood at a small screen size. These things can't be achieved by 
          simply scaling down an image.
        </p>
        <p>Responsive Images, using the 
          <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture">
            &lt;picture&gt;</a>
          </code> element and the 
          <code>
            <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">
              &lt;img&gt;
            </a>
          </code> <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes solve 
          both of these problems. You can provide multiple sizes along with 
          "hints" (meta data that describes the screen size and resolution the 
          image is best suited for), and the browser will choose the most 
          appropriate image for each device, ensuring that a user will 
          download an image size appropriate for the device they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also <em>art direct</em> images used at different sizes, 
          thus providing a different crop or completely different image to 
          different screen sizes.

        <header>Responsive Typography</header>
        <p>
          An element of responsive design not covered in earlier work was the 
          idea of responsive typography. Essentially, this describes changing 
          font sizes within media queries to reflect lesser or greater amounts 
          of screen real estate.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, we want to set our level 1 heading to be 
          <code>4rem</code>, meaning it will be four times our base font size. 
          That's a really large heading! We only want this jumbo heading on 
          larger screen sizes, therefore we first create a smaller heading 
          then use media queries to overwrite it with the larger size if we 
          know that the user has a screen size of at least 1200px.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>
          html { 
            font-size: 1em; 
          }
        
          h1 { 
            font-size: 2rem; 
          } 
        
          @media (min-width: 1200px) { 
            h1 {
              font-size: 4rem; 
            }
          } 
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          We have edited our responsive grid example above to also include 
          responsive type using the method outlined. You can see how the 
          heading switches sizes as the layout goes to the two column 
          version.
        </p>
        <p>
          On mobile the heading is smaller:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img 
            alt="A stacked layout with a small heading size." 
            src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16838/mdn-rwd-font-mobile.png" 
            style="display: block; height: 407px; width: 300px;">
            <p>
              On desktop however we see the larger heading size:
            </p>
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>        
        <figure>

        <p>
          As this approach to typography shows, you do not need to restrict 
          media queries to only changing the layout of the page. They can be 
          used to tweak any element to make it more usable or attractive at 
          alternate screen sizes.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Using_viewport_units_for_responsive_typography">
          Using viewport units for responsive typography
        </h3>
        <p>
          An interesting approach is to use the viewport unit <code>vw</code> 
          to enable responsive typography. <code>1vw</code> is equal to one 
          percent of the viewport width, meaning that if you set your font 
          size using <code>vw</code>, it will always relate to the size of the 
          viewport.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code> 
          h1 {
            font-size: 6vw;
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The problem with doing the above is that the user loses the ability 
          to zoom any text set using the vw unit, as that text is always 
          related to the size of the viewport. <strong>Therefore you should 
          never set text using viewport units alone</strong>.
        </p>        
        <p>
          There is a solution, and it involves using <code>
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc">calc()</a></code>. If you add 
          the <code>vw</code> unit to a value set using a fixed size such as 
          <code>em</code>s or <code>rem</code>s then the text will still be 
          zoomable. Essentially, the <code>vw</code> unit adds on top of that 
          zoomed value:
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>
          h1 {
            font-size: calc(1.5rem + 3vw);
          }
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This means that we only need to specify the font size for the 
          heading once, rather than set it up for mobile and redefine it in 
          the media queries. The font then gradually increases as you increase 
          the size of the viewport.

          If you look at the HTML source of a responsive page, you will 
          usually see the following <a 
          href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta> 
          element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML 
          meta-related elements, like &lt;base>, &lt;link>, &lt;script>, 
          &lt;style> or &lt;title>."><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a> tag in the 
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: html"><code>
          &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This meta tag tells mobile browsers that they should set the width 
          of the viewport to the device width, and scale the document to 100% 
          of its intended size, which shows the document at the mobile-
          optimized size that you intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this needed? Because mobile browsers tend to lie about their 
          viewport width.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meta tag exists because when the original iPhone launched and 
          people started to view websites on a small phone screen, most sites 
          were not mobile optimized. The mobile browser would therefore set 
          the viewport width to 960 pixels, render the page at that width, and 
          show the result as a zoomed-out version of the desktop layout. Other 
          mobile browsers (e.g. on Google Android) did the same thing. Users 
          could zoom in and pan around the website to view the bits they were 
          interested in, but it looked bad. You will still see this today if 
          you have the misfortune to come across a site that does not have a 
          responsive design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trouble is that your responsive design with breakpoints and 
          media queries won't work as intended on mobile browsers. If 
          you've got a narrow screen layout that kicks in at 480px viewport 
          width or less, and the viewport is set at 960px, you'll never see 
          your narrow screen layout on mobile. By setting 
          <code>width=device-width</code> you are overriding Apple's default 
          <code>width=960px</code> with the actual width of the device, so 
          your media queries will work as intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>So you should <em>always</em> include the above line of HTML 
          in the head of your documents.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other settings you can use with the viewport meta tag, 
          however in general the above line is what you will want to use.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>initial-scale</code>: Sets the initial zoom of the page, 
            which we set to 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>height</code>: Sets a specific height for the viewport.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>minimum-scale</code>: Sets the minimum zoom level.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>maximum-scale</code>: Sets the maximum zoom level.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>user-scalable</code>: Prevents zooming if set to 
            <code>no</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should avoid using <code>minimum-scale</code>, 
          <code>maximum-scale</code>, and in particular setting 
          <code>user-scalable</code> to <code>no</code>. Users should be 
          allowed to zoom as much or as little as they need to; preventing 
          this causes accessibility problems.

            <strong>Note</strong>: There is a CSS @ rule designed to replace 
            the viewport meta tag â€” <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@viewport">
            @viewport</a> â€” however it has poor browser support. It was 
            implemented in Internet Explorer and Edge, however once the 
            Chromium-based Edge ships it will no longer be part of the Edge 
            browser.

          Responsive design refers to a site or application design that 
          responds to the environment in which it is viewed. It 
          encompasses a number of CSS and HTML features and techniques, and is 
          now essentially just how we build websites by default. Consider the 
          sites that you visit on your phone â€” it is probably fairly unusual 
          to come across a site that is the desktop version scaled down, or 
          where you need to scroll sideways to find things. This is because 
          the web has moved to this approach of designing responsively.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has also become much easier to achieve responsive designs with 
          the help of the layout methods you have learned in these lessons. 
          If you are new to web development today you have many more tools at 
          your disposal than in the early days of responsive design. It is 
          therefore worth checking the age of any materials you are 
          referencing. While the historical articles are still useful, modern 
          use of CSS and HTML makes it far easier to create elegant and useful 
          designs, no matter what device your visitor views the site with.
