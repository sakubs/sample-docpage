          The term responsive design was coined by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, 
          and described the use of three techniques in combination.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first was the idea of fluid grids, something which was 
            already being explored by Gillenwater, and can be read up on in 
            Marcotte's article, 
            <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/" 
              target="_blank">
              Fluid Grids
            </a> (published in 2009 on A List Apart).
          </li>
          <li>
            The second technique was the idea of 
            <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images" 
              target="_blank">
              fluid images
            </a>. Using a very simple technique of setting the 
            <code>
              max-width
            </code> property to 
            <code>
              100%
            </code>, images would scale down smaller if their containing 
            column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but 
            never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit 
            in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not 
            grow larger and become pixellated if the column becomes wider 
            than the image.
          </li>
          <li>
            The third key component was the 
            <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries" target="_blank">
              media query
            </a>. 
            Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron 
            Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. 
            Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout 
            could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller 
            screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that <strong>responsive web design 
          isn't a separate technology</strong> — it is a term used to 
          describe an approach to web design, or a set of best practices, 
          used to create a layout that can <em>respond</em> to the device 
          being used to view the content. In Marcotte's original exploration 
          this meant flexible grids (using floats) and media queries, 
          however in the almost 10 years since that article was written, 
          working responsively has become the default. Modern CSS layout 
          methods are inherently responsive, and we have new things built 
          into the web platform to make designing responsive sites easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of this article will point you to the various web 
          platform features you might want to use when creating a 
          responsive site.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="Media_Queries">Media Queries</header>
        <p>
          Responsive design was only able to emerge due to the media query. 
          The Media Queries Level 3 specification became a Candidate 
          Recommendation in 2009, meaning that it was deemed ready for 
          implementation in browsers. Media Queries allow us to run a series 
          of tests (e.g. whether the user's screen is greater than a certain 
          width, or a certain resolution) and apply CSS selectively to 
          style the page appropriately for the user's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the following media query tests to see if the current 
          web page is being displayed as screen media (therefore not a 
          printed document) and the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide. 
          The CSS for the <code>.container</code> selector will only be 
          applied if these two things are true.
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre class="brush: css"><code>
            @media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
              .container {
                margin: 1em 2em;
              }
            }
          </code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add multiple media queries within a stylesheet, tweaking 
          your whole layout or parts of it to best suit the various screen 
          sizes. The points at which a media query is introduced, and the 
          layout changed, are known as <em>breakpoints</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common approach when using Media Queries is to create a simple 
          single-column layout for narrow-screen devices (e.g mobile phones), 
          then check for larger screens and implement a multiple column layout 
          when you know that you have enough screen width to handle it. This 
          is often described as <strong>mobile first</strong> design.

        <header id="Flexible_Grids">Flexible Grids</header>
        <p>
          Responsive sites don't just change their layout between breakpoints, 
          they are built on flexible grids. A flexible grid means that you 
          don't need to target every possible device size that there is, and 
          build a pixel perfect layout for it. That approach would be 
          impossible given the vast number of differently-sized devices that 
          exist, and the fact that on desktop at least, people do not always 
          have their browser window maximized.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using a flexible grid, you only need to add in a breakpoint and 
          change the design at the point where the content starts to look bad. 
          For example if the line lengths become unreadably long as the screen 
          size increases, or a box becomes squashed with two words on each line 
          as it narrows.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early days of responsive design our only option for performing 
          layout was to use <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats">
          floats</a>. Flexible floated layouts were achieved by giving each 
          element a percentage width, and ensuring that across the layout the 
          totals were not more than 100%. In his original piece on fluid grids, 
          Marcotte detailed a formula for taking a layout designed using pixels 
          and converting it into percentages.
        </p>
        <pre><code>target / context = result</code></pre>
        
        <p>
          For example if our target column size is 60 pixels, and the context 
          (or container) it is in is 960 pixels, we divide 60 by 960 to get a 
          value we can use in our CSS, after moving the decimal point two 
          places to the right.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: css"><code>.col { 
          width: 6.25%; /* 60 / 960 = 0.0625 */ 
        }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This approach will be found in many places across the web today, and 
          it is documented here in the layout section of our 
          <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Legacy_Layout_Methods">
          Legacy layout methods</a> article. It is likely that you will come 
          across websites using this approach in your work, so it is worth 
          understanding it, even though you would not build a modern site 
          using a float-based flexible grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example demonstrates a simple responsive design using 
          Media Queries and a flexible grid. On narrow screens the layout 
          displays the boxes stacked on top of one another:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img 
            alt="A mobile view of the layout with boxes stacked on 
            top of each other vertically." 
            src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16836/mdn-rwd-mobile.png" 
            style="display: block; height: 407px; width: 300px;">
            <p>
              On wider screens they move to two columns:
            </p>
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img 
            alt="A desktop view of a layout with two columns." 
            src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16837/mdn-rwd-desktop.png" 
            style="display: block; height: 217px; width: 600px;">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
